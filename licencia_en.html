	<b>NOTE:</b> TrascendentAR is and integration between ARToolKitv5 (LGPLv3) and libGDX(Apache 2.0), therefore the only compatible license for trascendentAR is
	LGPLv3. However the new ARToolKit version 6 is out and licensed under Apache 2.0. As soon as we update to the new ARToolKit version, this license may change
